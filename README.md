# Weather Forecasting 

Using TensorFlow and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks.

Background: research has shown that temperature, humidity, and wind can be accurately predicted out to 72hrs using a 15 year data period of hourly measurements. Mostly based on [this paper](https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume143/number11/zaytar-2016-ijca-910497.pdf).
